# Rationale â€“ Why?

The nature of agency work requires us to spin up lots of websites. This often results in many similar, but slightly different set ups. We think that it's possible to consolidate some of these aspects, especially things like the front-end folder structures and build tooling. 

**We are not saying that an individual app or site cannot grow its own codebase and architecture, by the way**.
